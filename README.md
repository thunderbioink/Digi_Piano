# Digi_Piano

In this final project, I will create with PYGAME, a piano keyboard, where the musical note corresponding to each key will play each time user clicks on that scpecific key. In this project, my purpose is to apply the four outcome concepts of Object Oriented Programming taught throughout the course: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Enjoy!
