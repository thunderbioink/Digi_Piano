# Digi_Piano

Using PYGAME, here is a digital piano keyboard, where the musical note corresponding to each key will play each time user clicks on that scpecific key. In this project, my purpose is to apply the four outcome concepts of Object Oriented Programming: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Enjoy!

Future Improvements:
1. Create a quicker click-sound response for each key.
2. Expand the keyboard to a normal piano octave range. 
3. Use cleaner audio clips with different release times.
