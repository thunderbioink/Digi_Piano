# Digi_Piano
In this final project, I will create with ASCII, a piano keyboard, that interacts with your computer keyboard to output the musical note sounds corresponding to each key. In this project, my purpose is to apply the four outcome concepts of Object Oriented Programming taught throughout the course: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Enjoy!
